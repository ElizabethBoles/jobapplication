Job Application Assignment homework for The Iron Yard DC


Mission of assignment
We'll start this project from a provided job application form page.
It uses Bootstrap for some simple styling. We will be handling a few different
events (see below) and performing various actions when they occur. One of these
actions will be to send the form data to a server. This is where we will want
to separate out our code into two modules: one to handle user interface (UI)
events, and one to handle the data sending and receiving. In the future we
may have many more different modules for different purposes.
